Blackjack, also known as twenty-one, is the most widely played casino banking 
game in the world. 
Blackjack is a comparing card game between a player and dealer, meaning that
players compete against the dealer but not against any other players. 

The object of the game is to "beat the dealer", which can be done in a 
number of ways:
•	Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a blackjack), 
	without a dealer blackjack;
•	Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21
•	Or let the dealer draw additional cards until his or her hand 
	exceeds 21.

The player and the dealer are each dealt two cards initially with one of 
the dealer's cards being dealt faced down (his hole card). 
The player may then ask for the dealer to repeatedly "hit" his hand 
by dealing him another card. 
If, at any point, the value of the player's hand exceeds 21, the player
is "busted" and loses immediately. 
At any point prior to busting, the player may "stand" and the dealer 
will then hit his hand until the value of his hand is 17 or more. 
If the dealer busts, the player wins. Otherwise, the player and dealer then 
compare the values of their hands and the hand with the higher value wins. 
The dealer wins ties.
